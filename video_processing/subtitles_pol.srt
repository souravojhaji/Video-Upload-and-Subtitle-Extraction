1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>And this one word</i>

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,917
<i>can make or break all our futures.</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,417
<i>And anyone who goes against the system</i>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,625
{\an8}<i>is either incredibly courageous</i>
<i>or super dumb.</i>

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,833
{\an8}RAM CHARAN PANDEY
(SUB INSPECTOR)

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,333
<i>And I, Ram Charan Pandey,</i>

7
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,542
<i>have never fallen prey</i>
<i>to this dangerous illusion of courage,</i>

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,375
and have never been inclined
to do so either.

9
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,292
Becauseâ€¦

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,417
no matter how hard a cockroach works out,

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,625
victory always belongs to the shoe.

12
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,667
All that is fine, sir.

13
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:55,292
But, sir, this Hindi and science lecture,

14
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,333
what does it have to do with my daughter?

15
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:01,750
It is related, Mandal-babu. It is.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,333
You've been negligent.

17
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:05,208
That's why your daughter went missing.

18
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,917
Action.

19
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,667
Reaction.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,458
Today is her birthday, sir.

21
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,792
She would have turned 15 today.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,958
Do you know, sir?

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,958
She was brilliant at her studies.

24
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,167
Extremely brilliant.

25
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,667
Since her last birthday,
she's been telling her mother

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,917
that if she tops this exam,

27
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,167
we have to buy her a TV.

28
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,708
Hello, Mandal-babu, listen to me.

29
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,750
Her results came out yesterday.

30
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,667
She came first.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,625
Now, we have to buy a TV for her.
Right, sir?

32
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,333
We'll have to. Right, sir?

33
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,375
Mandal-babu? Hello? Listen.

34
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,667
This is not the first time
a child has gone missing from Rajiv Camp.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
It's been going on for years.

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,833
We search for them, bring them back,
and they run away again.

37
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,292
We search for them again
and they run away again.

38
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,625
There's so much chasing that I've gone
from being Pandey to being PT Usha.

39
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,125
But nobody's giving me any medals, mister.

40
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:31,208
But, sir, you can at least lodge an FIR.
You can do that at least, sir.

41
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,333
Can't you at least do that, sir?

42
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:40,125
So now you're going to tell me
when and how to lodge an FIR?

43
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,250
Why not wear this uniform too
while you're at it?

44
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,167
No, sir. It's all right, sir.

45
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,083
She's 15 years old.
She'll come back, buddy.

46
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:55,458
She's dead by now, sir, isn't she?
Dead and gone.

47
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,917
Pathak, get some water.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,167
Okay.
