<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>The frequent disasters of the 
past year probably played a role,</i></font>

3
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:16,324

00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>what cursed spirits taste like.</i></font>

10
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:07,774
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's 
been used to clean up shit and vomit.</i></font>

11
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:09,614
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Exorcise.</i></font>

00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:15,964
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."</i></font>

00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:17,904
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>"I understood the ugliness of the masses,</i></font>

jujutsu sorcerer who saves others."</i></font>

16
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:30,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>That's what I've been telling 
myself ever since that day.</i></font>

17
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:32,324
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Ever since that day.</i></font>

18
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:39,134
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Apparently, this used to be 
the home of the president</font>

19
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">of a company managing a local 
chain of barbecue restaurants.</font>

20
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,234
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">However, in July of last year,</font>

21
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:51,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the mad cow disease breakout dealt 
a fatal blow to his restaurants,</font>

22
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,414
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">so he committed suicide with his family 
after they were buried under vast debt.</font>

23
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:59,374
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">From then on, local rumors claimed 
the president's home was haunted,</font>

24
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,384
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">so local school kids, college students 
from outside the prefecture,</font>

25
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:05,974
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">job-hoppers, and others would visit 
it as part of a test of courage,</font>

26
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:07,844
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and subsequently go missing.</font>

27
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,474
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Those rumors brought about more rumors,</font>

28
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:13,564
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and the damage just continued to spread.</font>

29
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Rumors do tend to spread rather 
quickly around haunted spots.</font>

30
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:25,394
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They can spread at an unbelievable 
pace nowadays, thanks to the Internet.</font>

31
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:30,164
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This all just means even more 
work for us jujutsu sorcerers.</font>

32
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:35,924
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In addition to that, three grade school kids 
went missing on their way home from school.</font>

33
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:39,414
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">There's also a high chance 
the families, police, colleagues,</font>

34
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:43,174
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and friends who trace the paths 
of those who disappeared</font>

35
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">will reach the mansion and 
become victims themselves.</font>

36
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:49,424
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We have to sever the root of 
this issue as soon as possible.</font>

37
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:55,004
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">HQ sent us to investigate because 
they reached the same conclusion.</font>

50
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,714

51
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:30,544
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The cause is almost certainly 
inside the building.</font>

00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:57,364

66
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,274
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">For now, let's have a 
look inside the building.</font>

67
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:39,084
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'll take this floor,</font>

00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,984

<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">N-No, i-it's fine.</font>

72
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:50,364
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Off you go, then.</font>

73
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,814
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Okay.</font>

74
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is the last one.</font>

75
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You could be the next big Scream Queen.</font>

78
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:40,154

79
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,824
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Are you done exploring the first floor?</font>

80
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is the first floor.</font>

81
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:50,544
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Huh?</font>

82
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:54,334
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I was walking down 
the first floor hallway.</font>

83
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What? But...</font>

84
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:02,454
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I know I entered a room 
at the end of the hallway...</font>

85
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,504
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A box of candy.</font>

86
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,644
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A bag of potato chips.</font>

87
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:08,684
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Cans.</font>

88
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,524
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A backpack.</font>

89
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,184
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">A sweatshirt.</font>

90
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,994
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've already seen this three times.</font>

91
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:21,974
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">And see these marks? I made 
them on my way through here.</font>

92
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:28,214
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It would seem that we're already 
in the belly of the beast.</font>

93
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,444
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Huh?</font>

94
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">For real?</font>

95
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:43,674
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How long <i>is</i> this hallway?</font>

96
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,834
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We've been moving for thirty minutes,</font>

97
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,094
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">so about four kilometers so far.</font>

98
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's not an innate domain, is it?</font>

99
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:54,834
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It's not.</font>

100
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:58,194
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Those are manifestations 
of the spirit's mindscape.</font>

101
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,134
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Which means...</font>

102
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:01,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This is a barrier.</font>

103
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,484
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Correct.</font>

104
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:07,124
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Most likely, the victims 
were trapped inside this</font>

105
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,224
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and then killed by the cursed spirit.</font>

106
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Though, considering the 
use of this technique,</font>

107
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:17,164
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the cursed spirit itself should be weak.</font>

108
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:21,074
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So if we can just escape this barrier...</font>

109
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:25,754
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Now, quiz time.</font>

110
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,124
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">How would you break this, Utahime?</font>

111
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">This hallway is repeating itself.</font>

112
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">At first...</font>

113
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,784
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I thought...</font>

114
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,094
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I'm surprised you could touch them.</font>

115
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,954
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">...it was shaped like a donut.</font>

116
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:52,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">But we passed by four of 
the marks you made, right?</font>

117
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:55,704
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">When I calculated how many 
paces apart they were, I got...</font>

118
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,314
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">122,</font>

119
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:58,454
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">203,</font>

120
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,774
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">157,</font>

121
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:00,704
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and 270 paces.</font>

122
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:05,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So the spacing between marks was random.</font>

123
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:06,674
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I see.</font>

124
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:11,224
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The interval between 
repetitions isn't standardized.</font>

125
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:14,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Which means that, most likely...</font>

126
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,814
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">this barrier is patching spaces together.</font>

127
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:23,394
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So if we both run down the hallway 
at top speed, then at some point...</font>

128
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:28,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It'll break.</font>

129
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,404
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Close. Ninety points.</font>

130
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,414
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">D'oh.</font>

131
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:35,654
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's the remaining ten?</font>

132
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:41,544
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">When we run, we do so in opposite

134
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,144

135
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:47,914

136
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:51,204
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">that makes it harder for the cursed

137
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:54,204

00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,154
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">is the one compatible with Tengen-sama.</font>

254
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,274

255
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:36,284
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Escort a brat and erase her?</font>

256
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,194
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's right.</font>

257
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:39,754
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Have you finally gone senile?</font>

258
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It is spring.</font>

259
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,284

with being the next principal.</font>

260
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Jokes aside, thoughâ€”</font>

261
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:49,084
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}I'll be the one to decide 
if I let that off as a joke.</font>

262
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:50,434
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Is this about renewing 
Tengen-sama's technique?</font>

263
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:52,954
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's that?</font>

264
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:57,544
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What?</font>

265
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,264
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Tengen-sama possesses the 
cursed technique of Immortality,</font>

266
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,784
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but it is not Eternal Youth.</font>

267
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:05,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It wouldn't be an issue 
if all he did was get older,</font>

268
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,844
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but after his body ages to a certain point,</font>

269
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,594
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the cursed technique 
begins rewriting his body.</font>

270
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Evolution.</font>

271
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:17,024
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">He'll cease to be human and become 
a higher form of existence.</font>

272
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,934
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What's wrong with that?</font>

273
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,714
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Sounds cool.</font>

274
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,344
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">According to Tengen-sama,</font>

275
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:26,384
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">those who reach that state 
of being have no will.</font>

276
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,784
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It means Tengen-sama would 
cease to be Tengen-sama.</font>

277
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:31,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">{\an8}<font size="16"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#2b362a">Tokyo Jujutsu High School</font></font></font></font>

278
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:31,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">All the jujutsu schools,</font>

279
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,984
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the barriers that form the 
foundation of jujutsu society,</font>

280
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:36,354
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">the many barrier techniques 
of the assistant supervisors...</font>

281
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:40,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">They're all being strengthened by Tengen-sama.</font>

282
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,304
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Without the aid of his power,</font>

283
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:46,324
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">we could hardly maintain security 
or clean up after missions.</font>

284
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,134
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">In the worst-case scenario,</font>

285
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,644
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Tengen-sama could even become 
a threat to mankind.</font>

286
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,964
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's why, every 500 years, 
he finds the Star Plasma Vesselâ€”</font>

287
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:58,364
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">someone who is compatible with himâ€”</font>

288
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,524
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and assimilates them, 
overwriting the information of their body.</font>

289
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,764
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">By renewing his body,</font>

290
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:05,284
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">he resets his cursed 
technique back to the start</font>

291
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,044
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">and avoids Evolution.</font>

292
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,454
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I get it.</font>

293
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,004
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">It would be fine if he turned 
into MetalGreymon,</font>

294
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but we can't have him 
becoming SkullGreymon.</font>

295
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:16,284
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">So we have him start over from Koromon.</font>

296
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,764
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">What? Yeah, sure, that works.</font>

297
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:24,074
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Star Plasma Vessel's 
location has been leaked.</font>

298
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:28,354
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Right now, there are two major 
groups after the young girl's life.</font>

299
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:31,004
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">One is the Curse User Group Q,</font>

300
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:35,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">which seeks to upend jujutsu society 
with Tengen-sama's rampage.</font>

301
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,034
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The other is the Star Religious 
Group, also known as the</font>

302
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,874
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">"Time Vessel Association,"
which worships Tengen-sama as a god.</font>

303
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:48,144
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Tengen-sama will assimilate the 
Star Plasma Vessel two days from now.</font>

304
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:53,014
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You are to protect the girl until then and 
ensure that she reaches Tengen-sama!</font>

305
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:57,004
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">If you fail, the effects will ripple 
throughout even normal society!</font>

306
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,584
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Don't forget that!</font>

307
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:00,834
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Yeah, but you know,</font>

308
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,724
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I get why Curse User Group Q 
would be after her,</font>

309
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:07,014
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but why would this Star Religious 
Group want to kill a brat?</font>

310
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,884
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Their object of worship is 
the pure form of Tengen-sama.</font>

311
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,694
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Allowing the Star Plasma Vesselâ€”</font>

312
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,444
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">in their minds, an impurityâ€”
to blend into him is unforgivable.</font>

313
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,084
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The Star Religious Group is an 
organization of non-sorcerers.</font>

314
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,224
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I don't think we need to pay them any mind.</font>

315
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">The ones to be wary of are Q.</font>

316
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,064
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.</font>

317
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,904
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We're the strongest, after all.</font>

318
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:32,014
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">That's why Tengen-sama asked 
for us specifically, right?</font>

319
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,364
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>What is it?</i></font>

320
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,394
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You know, Satoru...</font>

321
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,684
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">I've been wanting to say this for a while,</font>

322
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,214
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">but you should stop being 
so full of yourself.</font>

323
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,044
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Huh?!</font>

324
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:48,804
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Especially when you're 
addressing your superiors.</font>

325
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:51,404
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">We might end up meeting 
Tengen-sama, after all.</font>

326
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:55,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You should be more polite and humble.</font>

327
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:57,284
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">You'd scare your juniors less, too.</font>

328
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:58,014
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24"><i>Hah!</i></font>

329
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,604
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Screw that!</font>

330
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,754
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Come on, Satoru.</font>

331
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:02,974
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="24">Whatever.</font>

00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,524
